A collection of ideas I have for programming languages. In example code, you may notice a mismatch of what features the example code assumes exist.

I tend to write example code assuming that the features I talk about in the `strongIdeas/` directory will be composed into one language, but I'm not good at following that rule. Example code will be very hodgepodge-y, including old versions of syntax I imagined before refining ideas.
