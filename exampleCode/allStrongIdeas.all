// This document demonstrates how several language features compose together:
// - Functions as literal values
// - Function argument sugar: parameters accessed via %n, named params desugar to %0, %1, etc.
// - State-based methods: functions can take an implicit 'state' (like 'this'), accessed via .field
// - Composition via delegation: 'delegate' = 'route' (expose fields) + 'substitute' (type conversion)
// - Namespace resolution: creates types like namespace_statename (e.g., apple_instance)
// - Different reference types with clearer and more expressive syntax than C/C++
// Annotations generated by Claude AI after detailed explanation and clarified by me.

// Function with no declaration using parameter enumeration
// `sub` becomes a generic function which must be cast to a concrete one before use.
// cast can be done implicitly at the callsite, as long as the type and arity implied by the call can be mapped to this generic.
sub = ${return %0 - %1};
// This example uses implicit enumeration
// Each `%` desugars to the next `n`.
add = ${return % + %};

print = ${%0@print()};

void(char* message) printHelloAnd = ${
    char* message = %0;
